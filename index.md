# Introduction

Welcome to the fmin.xyz - an attempt to build an intuitive systematic review of optimization theory, methods, and applications.

The site contains the following parts:

* {% include link.html title="Theory"%}
* {% include link.html title="Methods"%
* {% include link.html title="Exercises"%}
* {% include link.html title="Applications"%}
* {% include link.html title="Materials"%}

The site has a simple built-in search üîç. You can use it to find anything you want.

Rules of formatting and contributing could be found on the [readme page](https://github.com/MerkulovDaniil/optim) on the github repo.

# Principles

* This site is aimed at researchers and enthusiasts with some prior expertise in the field (not just the Wikipedia clone).
* The fundamental primitive structure of this site is the page.
* The page should consists of short self-sufficient material about the topic.
* If the page is based on paper, bibtex label should be added at the beginning.
* The general structure of the site is flexible and should be improved over the time iteratively.

# Notations and terms

These notations will be used by default (unless otherwise specified)

* $$\theta$$ -- optimizing variable
* $$\mathbb{R}^p$$ -- $$p$$-dimensional Euclidian space
* $$\theta^*$$ -- global optimizer of the problem
* $$\| \cdot \|$$ -- norm of the vector(matrix) (if nothing specified, we often use Euclidian (Frobenius) norm)
* $$\| \cdot \|_*$$ -- dual norm (norm in dual space) (if nothing specified, we often use Euclidian (Frobenius) norm)
