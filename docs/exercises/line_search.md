1. Which function is called unimodal?
1. Derive the convergence speed for a dichotomy method for a unimodal function. What type of convergence does this method have?
1. Consider the function $$f(x) = (x + \sin x) e^x, \;\;\; x \in [-20, 0]$$.

    Consider the following modification of solution localization method, in which the interval $$[a,b]$$ is divided into $$2$$ parts in a fixed proportion of $$t: x_t = a + t*(b-a)$$ (maximum twice at iteration - as in the dichotomy method). Experiment with different values of $$t \in [0,1]$$ and plot the dependence of $$N (t)$$ - the number of iterations needed to achieve $$\varepsilon$$ - accuracy from the $$t$$ parameter. Consider $$\varepsilon = 10^{-7}$$. Note that with $$t = 0.5$$ this method is exactly the same as the dichotomy method.
1. Describe the idea of successive parabolic interpolation. What type of convergence does this method have?
1. Write down Armijoâ€“Goldstein condition.
