# Projection
1. Let us have two different points $$a, b \in \mathbb{R}^n$$. Prove that the set of points which in the Euclidean norm are closer to the point $$a$$ than to $$b$$ make up a half-space. Is this true for another norm?
1. Find $$\pi_S (y) = \pi$$ if $$S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \|x - x_c\| \le R \}$$, $$y \notin S$$
1. Find $$\pi_S (y) = \pi$$ if $$S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid c^T x = b \}$$, $$y \notin S$$
1. Find $$\pi_S (y) = \pi$$ if $$S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid Ax = b, A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, b \in \mathbb{R}^{m} \}$$, $$y \notin S$$
1. Illustrate the geometric inequality that connects $$\pi_S(y), y \notin S, x \in S$$, from which it follows that $$\pi_S(y)$$ is a projection of the $$y$$ point onto a convex set of $$S$$.
1. For which sets does the projection of the point outside this set exist? Unique?
1. Find $$\pi_S (y) = \pi$$ if $$S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid c^T x \ge b \}$$
1. Find $$\pi_S (y) = \pi$$ if $$S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid x = x_0 + X \alpha, X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^{m}\}$$, $$y \in S$$
1. Let $$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$$ be a closed set, and $$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ be a point not lying in it. Show that the projection in $$l_2$$ norm will be unique, while in $$l_\infty$$ norm this statement is not valid.
1. Find the projection of the matrix $$X$$ on a set of matrices of rank $$k, \;\;\; X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, k \leq n \leq m$$. In Frobenius norm and spectral norm.
1. Find a projection of the $$X$$ matrix on a set of symmetrical positive semi-definite matrices of $$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$. In Frobenius norm and the scalar product associated with it.
1. Find the projection $$\pi_S(y)$$ of point $$y$$ onto the set $$ S = \{x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid \mid \vert x_1\vert + \vert x_2\vert = 1 \} $$ in $$\| \cdot \|_1$$ norm. Consider the different positions of $$y$$.
1. Find $$\pi_S (y) = \pi$$, if $$S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \alpha_i \le x_i \le \beta_i, i = 1, \ldots, n \}$$.
1. Prove that projection is a nonexpansive operator, i.e. prove, that if $$S \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$$ is nonempty, closed and convex set, then for any $$(x_{1}, x_{2}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \times \mathbb{R}^{n}$$
    
    $$
    \lVert \pi_{S}(x_{2}) - \pi_{S}(x_{1}) \rVert_{2} \leq \lVert x_{2} - x_{1} \rVert_{2}
    $$
