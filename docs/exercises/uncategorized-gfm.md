1.  Show, that these conditions are equivalent:

    $$
      \|\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(z) \| \le L \|x-z\| 
     $$

    and

    $$
     f(z) \le f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(z-x) + \frac L 2 \|z-x\|^2
     $$

2.  We say that the function belongs to the class $f  \in C^{k,p}_L (Q)$
    if it is $k$ times continuously differentiable on $Q$, and the $p$
    derivative has a Lipschitz constant $L$.

    $$
     \|\nabla^p f(x) - \nabla^p f(y)\| \leq L \|x-y\|, \qquad \forall x,y \in Q
     $$

    The most commonly used $C_L^{1,1}, C_L^{2,2}$ for $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    Notice that:

    - $p \leq k$
    - If $q \geq k$, then $C_L^{q,p} \subseteq C_L^{k,p}$. The higher is
      the order of the derivative, the stronger is the limitation (fewer
      functions belong to the class).

    Prove that the function belongs to the class
    $C_L^{2,1}. \subseteq C_L^{1,1}$ if and only if
    $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n$:

    $$
     \|\nabla^2 f(x)\| \leq L
     $$

    Prove that the last condition can be rewritten in the form without
    loss of generality:

    $$
     -L I_n \preceq \nabla^2 f(x) \preceq L I_n
     $$

3.  Show that for gradient descent with the following stepsize selection
    strategies:

    - constant step $h_k = \dfrac{1}{L}$
    - Dropping sequence
      $h_k = \dfrac{\alpha_k}{L}, \quad \alpha_k \to 0$.

    you can get the estimation of the function decrease at the iteration
    of the view:

    $$
     f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}) \geq \dfrac{\omega}{L}\|\nabla f(x_k)\|^2
     $$

    $\omega > 0$ - some constant, $L$ - Lipschitz constant of the
    function gradient.
