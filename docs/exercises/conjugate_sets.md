1. Find a dual cone for a monotonous non-negative cone: 
    
    $$

1. Draw a conjugate set by hand for simple sets. Conjugate to zero, conjugate to the halfline, to two random points, to their convex hull, etc.
1. Give examples of self-conjugate sets.
1. Using a lemma about a cone conjugate, conjugate to the sum of cones and a lemma about a cone, conjugate to the intersection of closed convex cones, prove that cones
    
    $$
    K_1 = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid x = Ay, y \ge 0, y \in \mathbb{R}^m, A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times}, \}, \;\; K_2 = \{p \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid A^Tp \ge 0\}
    $$
    
    are inter-conjugated.
1. Find the sets $$S^{*}, S^{**}, S^{***}$$, if 
    
    $$
    S = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1 + x_2 \ge 0, \;\; 2x_1 + x_2 \ge -4, \;\; -2x_1 + x_2 \ge -4\}

1. Find conjugate cone for the cone of positive definite (semi-definite) matrices.

    $$

1. Prove that's fair for closed convex cones:

    * \$$K = \mathbb{R}^2$$
    * \$$K = \{(x_1, x_2) \mid \vert x_1\vert \leq x_2\}$$
    * \$$K = \{(x_1, x_2) \mid x_1 + x_2 = 0\}$$

    $$
    S^* = \{y \ \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \langle y, x\rangle \le 1 \;\; \forall x \in S\},

1. Prove, that $$B_p$$ and $$B_{p_*}$$ are inter-conjugate, i.e. $$(B_p)^* = B_{p_*}, (B_{p_*})^* = B_p$$, where $$B_p$$ is the unit ball (w.r.t. $$p$$ - norm) and $$p, p_*$$ are conjugated, i.e. $$p^{-1} + p^{-1}_* = 1$$. You can assume, that $$p_* = \infty$$ if $$p = 1$$ and vice versa.

1. Prove, that $$K_p$$ and $$K_{p_*}$$ are inter-conjugate, i.e. $$(K_p)^* = K_{p_*}, (K_{p_*})^* = K_p$$, where $$K_p = \left\{ [x, \mu] \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \|x\|_p \leq \mu \right\}, \; 1 < p < \infty$$ is the unit ball (w.r.t. $$p$$ - norm) and $$p, p_*$$ are conjugated, i.e. $$p^{-1} + p^{-1}_* = 1$$. You can assume, that $$p_* = \infty$$ if $$p = 1$$ and vice versa.

1. Suppose, $$S = S^*$$. Could the set $$S$$ be anything, but a unit ball? If it can, provide an example of another self-conjugate set. If it couldn't, prove it.
