<p>Consider simple yet practical case of equality constraints:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } &amp; h_i(x) = 0, i = 1, \ldots, p
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>The basic idea of Lagrange method implies the switch from conditional to unconditional optimization through increasing the dimensionality of the problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
L(x, \nu) = f(x) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^p \nu_i h_i(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n, \nu \in \mathbb{R}^p} \\

<p>One can verify, that <span class="math inline">\nabla^2 f(0, 0) = \mathbb{0}</span> and <span class="math inline">\nabla f(0, 0) = (0, 0)</span>, but <span class="math inline">(0, 0)</span> is not a local minimizer. Although the surface does not have a local minimizer at the origin, its intersection with any vertical plane through the origin (a plane with equation <span class="math inline">y=mx</span> or <span class="math inline">x=0</span>) is a curve that has a local minimum at the origin.

Nevertheless, <span class="math inline">(0,0)</span> is not a local minimizer of the function, because moving along a parabola such as <span class="math inline">y=\sqrt{2}x^2</span> will cause the function value to decrease.</p>

<p>One more important result for convex unconstrained case sounds as follows. If <span class="math inline">f(x): S \to \mathbb{R}</span> - convex function defined on the convex set <span class="math inline">S</span>, then:</p>

<p>Things are pretty simple and intuitive in unconstrained problem. In this section we will add one equality constraint, i.e.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}

<p>We will try to illustrate approach to solve this problem through the simple example with <span class="math inline">f(x) = x_1 + x_2</span> and <span class="math inline">h(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2</span>.</p>

<p>Generally: in order to move from <span class="math inline">x_F</span> along the budget set towards decreasing the function, we need to guarantee two conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\langle \delta x, \nabla h(x_F) \rangle = 0
</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">
\langle \delta x, - \nabla f(x_F) \rangle &gt; 0
</span></p>
<p>Let’s assume, that in the process of such a movement we have come to the point where <span class="math display">
-\nabla f(x) = \nu \nabla h(x)
</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">
\langle  \delta x, - \nabla f(x)\rangle = \langle  \delta x, \nu\nabla h(x)\rangle = 0  
</span></p>
<p>Then we came to the point of the budget set, moving from which it will not be possible to reduce our function. This is the local minimum in the constrained problem :)</p>

<p>So let’s define a Lagrange function (just for our convenience):</p>
<p><span class="math display">
L(x, \nu) = f(x) + \nu h(x)
</span></p>
<p>Then if the problem is <em>regular</em> (we will define it later) and the point <span class="math inline">x^*</span> is the local minimum of the problem described above, then there exist <span class="math inline">\nu^*</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; \text{Necessary conditions} \\
&amp; \nabla_x L(x^*, \nu^*) = 0 \text{ that's written above}\\

% &amp; \forall y \neq 0 \in \mathbb{R}^n : \nabla h(x^*)^\top y = 0
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>We should notice that <span class="math inline">L(x^*, \nu^*) = f(x^*)</span>.</p>

<p>So, we have a problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } &amp; g(x) \leq 0
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Two possible cases:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%">
<col style="width: 50%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">g(x) \leq 0</span> is inactive. <span class="math inline">g(x^*) &lt; 0</span></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">g(x) \leq 0</span> is active. <span class="math inline">g(x^*) = 0</span></th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">g(x^*) &lt; 0</span> <br> <span class="math inline">\nabla f(x^*) = 0</span><br> <span class="math inline">\nabla^2 f(x^*) &gt; 0</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Necessary conditions <br> <span class="math inline">g(x^*) = 0</span> <br> <span class="math inline">- \nabla f(x^*) = \lambda \nabla g(x^*)</span>, <span class="math inline">\lambda &gt; 0</span> <br> Sufficient conditions <br> <span class="math inline">\langle y, \nabla^2_{xx} L(x^*, \lambda^*) y \rangle &gt; 0,</span> <br> <span class="math inline">\forall y \neq 0 \in \mathbb{R}^n : \nabla g(x^*)^\top y = 0</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Combining two possible cases, we can write down the general conditions for the problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
&amp; f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } &amp; g(x) \leq 0 \\
&amp;
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>Let’s define the Lagrange function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
L (x, \lambda) = f(x) + \lambda g(x)
</span></p>
<p>The classical Karush-Kuhn-Tucker first and second order optimality conditions for a local minimizer <span class="math inline">x^*</span>, stated under the linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ) (or other regularity conditions), can be written as follows:</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">x^*</span> is a local minimum of the problem described above, then there exists a unique Lagrange multiplier <span class="math inline">\lambda^*</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{split}
    &amp; (1) \; \nabla_x L (x^*, \lambda^*) = 0 \\
    &amp; (2) \; \lambda^* \geq 0 \\
    &amp; (3) \; \lambda^* g(x^*) = 0 \\
    &amp; (4) \; g(x^*) \leq 0\\
    &amp; (5) \; \forall y \in C(x^*):  \langle y , \nabla^2_{xx} L(x^*, \lambda^*) y \rangle &gt; 0 \\
    &amp;  \text{where } C(x^*) = \{y \ \in \mathbb{R}^n |  \nabla f(x^*) ^\top y \leq 0 \text{ and } \forall i \in I(x^*):  \nabla g_i(x^*)^⊤ y \leq 0
    \} \text{ is the critical cone.} \\
    &amp; I(x^*) = \{i| g_i(x^*) = 0\} \\
\end{split}
</span></p>
<p>It’s noticeable, that <span class="math inline">L(x^*, \lambda^*) = f(x^*)</span>. Conditions <span class="math inline">\lambda^* = 0 , (1), (4)</span> are the first scenario realization, and conditions <span class="math inline">\lambda^* &gt; 0 , (1), (3)</span> - the second one.</p>

<p>These conditions are required in order to make KKT solutions the necessary conditions. Some of them even turn necessary conditions into sufficient (for example, Slater’s). Moreover, if you have regularity, you can write down necessary second order conditions <span class="math inline">\langle y , \nabla^2_{xx} L(x^*, \lambda^*, \nu^*) y \rangle \geq 0</span> with <em>semi-definite</em> hessian of Lagrangian.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slater’s condition</strong>. If for a convex problem (i.e., assuming minimization, <span class="math inline">f_0,f_{i}</span> are convex and <span class="math inline">h_{i}</span> are affine), there exists a point <span class="math inline">x</span> such that <span class="math inline">h(x)=0</span> and <span class="math inline">f_{i}(x)&lt;0</span> (existance of a strictly feasible point), then we have a zero duality gap and KKT conditions become necessary and sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Linearity constraint qualification</strong> If <span class="math inline">f_{i}</span> and <span class="math inline">h_{i}</span> are affine functions, then no other condition is needed.</li>
