# Idea
We divide a segment into two equal parts and choose the one that contains the solution of the problem using the values of functions. 
# Algorithm
```python
def binary_search(f, a, b, epsilon):
    c = (a + b) / 2
    while abs(b - a) > epsilon:
        y = (a + c) / 2.0
        if f(y) <= f(c):
            b = c
            c = y
        else:
            z = (b + c) / 2.0
            if f(c) <= f(z):
                a = y
                b = z
            else:
                a = c
                c = z
    return c
```

# Bounds
The length of the line segment on $$k+1$$-th iteration:

$$
\Delta_{k+1} = b_{k+1} - a_{k+1} = \dfrac{1}{2^k}(b-a)
$$

For unimodal functions, this holds if we select the middle of a segment as an output of the iteration $$x_{k+1}$$: 

$$
|x_{k+1} - x_*| \leq \dfrac{\Delta_{k+1}}{2} \leq \dfrac{1}{2^{k+1}}(b-a) \leq (0.5)^{k+1} (b-a)
$$

Note, that at each iteration we ask oracle no more, than 2 times, so the number of function evaluations is $$N = 2 k$$, which implies:

$$
|x_{k+1} - x_*| \leq (0.5)^{\frac{N}{2}+1} (b-a) \leq  (0.707)^{N}  \frac{b-a}{2}
$$

By equating the right side of the last inequality with $$\varepsilon$$, we get the number of method iterations needed to achieve $$\varepsilon$$ accuracy:

$$
K = \left\lceil \log_2 \dfrac{b-a}{\varepsilon} - 1 \right\rceil
$$
