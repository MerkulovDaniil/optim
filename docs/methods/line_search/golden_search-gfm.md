# Golden search


## Idea

The idea is quite similar to the dichotomy method. There are two golden
points on the line segment (left and right) and the insightful idea is,
that on the next iteration one of the points will remain the golden
point.

## Algorithm

``` python
def golden_search(f, a, b, epsilon):
    tau = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    y = a + (b - a) / tau**2
    z = a + (b - a) / tau
    while b - a > epsilon:
        if f(y) <= f(z):
            b = z
            z = y
            y = a + (b - a) / tau**2
        else:
            a = y
            y = z
            z = a + (b - a) / tau
    return (a + b) / 2
```

## Bounds

$$
|x_{k+1} - x_*| \leq b_{k+1} - a_{k+1} = \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \right)^{N-1} (b - a) \approx 0.618^k(b-a),
$$

where $\tau = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$.

- The geometric progression constant **more** than the dichotomy
  method - $0.618$ worse than $0.5$
- The number of function calls **is less** than for the dichotomy
  method - $0.707$ worse than $0.618$ - (for each iteration of the
  dichotomy method, except for the first one, the function is calculated
  no more than 2 times, and for the gold method - no more than one)
