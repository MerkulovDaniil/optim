# Adaptive metric methods


It is known, that antigradient $-\nabla f (x_0)$ is the direction of the
steepest descent of the function $f(x)$ at point $x_0$. However, we can
introduce another concept for choosing the best direction of function
decreasing.

Given $f(x)$ and a point $x_0$. Define
$B_\varepsilon(x_0) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : d(x, x_0) = \varepsilon^2 \}$
as the set of points with distance $\varepsilon$ to $x_0$. Here we
presume the existence of a distance function $d(x, x_0)$.

$$
x^* = \text{arg}\min_{x \in B_\varepsilon(x_0)} f(x)
$$

Then, we can define another *steepest descent* direction in terms of
minimizer of function on a sphere:

$$
s = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{x^* - x_0}{\varepsilon}
$$

Let us assume that the distance is defined locally by some metric $A$:

$$
d(x, x_0) = (x-x_0)^\top A (x-x_0)
$$

Let us also consider first order Taylor approximation of a function
$f(x)$ near the point $x_0$:

$$
\tag{A1}
f(x_0 + \delta x) \approx f(x_0) + \nabla f(x_0)^\top \delta x
$$

Now we can explicitly pose a problem of finding $s$, as it was stated
above.

$$
\begin{split}
&\min_{\delta x \in \mathbb{R^n}} f(x_0 + \delta x) \\
\text{s.t.}\;& \delta x^\top A \delta x = \varepsilon^2
\end{split}
$$

Using $\text{(A1)}$ it can be written as:

$$
\begin{split}
&\min_{\delta x \in \mathbb{R^n}} \nabla f(x_0)^\top \delta x \\
\text{s.t.}\;& \delta x^\top A \delta x = \varepsilon^2
\end{split}
$$

Using Lagrange multipliers method, we can easily conclude, that the
answer is:

$$
\delta x = - \frac{2 \varepsilon^2}{\nabla f (x_0)^\top A^{-1} \nabla f (x_0)} A^{-1} \nabla f
$$

Which means, that new direction of steepest descent is nothing else, but
$A^{-1} \nabla f(x_0)$.

Indeed, if the space is isotropic and $A = I$, we immediately have
gradient descent formula, while Newton method uses local Hessian as a
metric matrix.
