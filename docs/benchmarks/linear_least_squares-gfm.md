# Linear Least Squares


## Problem

In a least-squares, or linear regression, problem, we have measurements
$A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and seek a
vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $A x$ is close to $b$. Closeness
is defined as the sum of the squared differences:

$$
f(x) = \|Ax - b\|_2^2 \to \min_{x \in \mathbb{R^n}}
$$
