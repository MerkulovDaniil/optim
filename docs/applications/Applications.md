This section contains self-sufficient examples of numerical applications with Python code.
Most of the examples are covered in the Boyd [book](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/).
There are also some very useful link about applications with code:
* [CVXOPT examples](https://cvxopt.org/examples/index.html)
* [CVXPY examples](https://www.cvxpy.org/examples/index.html)
* [Alexandr Katrutsa demos](https://colab.research.google.com/github/amkatrutsa/MIPT-Opt/blob/master/01-Intro/demos.ipynb)
