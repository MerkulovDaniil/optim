# Rendezvous problem


## Problem

![Illustration](rendezvous.svg)

We have two bodies in discrete time: the first is described by its
coordinate $x_i$ and its speed $v_i$, the second has coordinate $z_i$
and speed $u_i$. Each body has its own dynamics, which we denote as
linear systems with matrices $A, B, C, D$:

$$
\begin{align*}
x_{i+1} = Ax_i + Bu_i \\
z_{i+1} = Cz_i + Dv_i
\end{align*}
$$

We want these bodies to meet in future at some point $T$ in such a way,
that preserve minimum energy through the path. We will consider only
kinetic energy, which is proportional to the squared speed at each point
of time, thatâ€™s why optimization problem takes the following form:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \min \sum_{i=1}^T \|u_i\|_2^2 + \|v_i\|_2^2 \\
\text{s.t. } & x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t, \; t = 1,\ldots,T-1\\
& z_{t+1} = Cz_t + Dv_t, \; t = 1,\ldots,T-1\\
& x_T = z_T
\end{align*}
$$

Problem of this type arise in space engineering - just imagine, that the
first body is the spaceship, while the second, say, Mars.
