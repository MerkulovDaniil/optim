# Minimum volume ellipsoid


## Problem

Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ be the points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Given these
points we need to find an ellipsoid, that contains all points with the
minimum volume (in 2d case volume of an ellipsoid is just the square).

An invertible linear transformation applied to a unit sphere produces an
ellipsoid with the square, that is $\det A^{-1}$ times bigger, than the
unit sphere square, thatâ€™s why we parametrize the interior of ellipsoid
in the following way:

$$
S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \; | \; u = Ax + b, \|u\|_2^2 \leq 1\}
$$

Sadly, the determinant is the function, which is relatively hard to
minimize explicitly. However, the function
$\log \det A^{-1} = -\log \det A$ is actually convex, which provides a
great opportunity to work with it. As soon as we need to cover all the
points with ellipsoid of minimum volume, we pose an optimization problem
on the convex function with convex restrictions:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \min_{A \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}, b \in \mathbb{R}^{2}} -\log\det(A)\\
\text{s.t. } & \|Ax_i + b\| \leq 1, i = 1, \ldots, n\\
& A \succ 0
\end{align*}
$$
